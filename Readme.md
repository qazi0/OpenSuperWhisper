## Models

### Whisper Models

You can download Whisper model files (`.bin`) from the [Whisper.cpp Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main). Place the downloaded `.bin` files in the app's models directory. On first launch, the app will attempt to copy a default model automatically, but you can add more models manually.

### Parakeet MLX Models

OpenSuperWhisper also supports Parakeet models optimized for Apple Silicon using MLX. The app includes built-in support for downloading Parakeet models directly from the interface, including:
- Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v2 (English-focused)
- Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-v3 (Multilingual support)

You can also manually download Parakeet models from [Hugging Face MLX Community](https://huggingface.co/mlx-community) repositories.
